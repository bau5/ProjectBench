- Cleaned up all things packets.

- Mk. II changed:  
    Server no longer maintains a running list as users are adding items, only displays the list 
   that the client sends it. When a user clicks on an item to be crafted in the matrix, it sends
   a packet to the server and the server determines if that ItemStack can be crafted from the 
   components supplied. If it can, then the server agrees. If it can't, it redistributes the 
   container to the player.
